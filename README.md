# Spy Game
This tutorial is part of the Internet of Tricks Erasmus+ Project. You will create a Spy Game in Python, where users can figure out which persona is guilty from a list of suspects. As a demo, we started with the Meatball Thief, a game where you must find out who stole the meatballs from famous imaginary restaurants in Stockholm.
